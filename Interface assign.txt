1. An interface in Java is a mechanism that is used to achieve complete abstraction. It is basically a kind of
class that contains only constants and abstract methods.

2. Ans: Only abstract and public modifiers are allowed for methods in interfaces.

3. There are many reasons to use interfaces in java. They are as follows:
a. An interface is used to achieve full abstraction.
b. Using interfaces is the best way to expose our projectâ€™s API to some other project.
c. Programmers use interfaces to customise features of software differently for different objects.
d. By using interface, we can achieve the functionality of multiple inheritance.

4. abstract class :
   1. Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
   2. Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.
   3. Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables.
   4. Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface.

   Interface :
   1. Interface can have only abstract methods. Since Java 8, it can have default and static
      methods also      
   2. Interface supports multiple inheritance
   3. Interface has only static and final variables.
   4. Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class.
